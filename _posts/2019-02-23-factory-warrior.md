I was high on life when placement volunteer announced my name as the only one who has been selected to work for a leading Chemical company. All more important was that the location of work happened to be Goa - India's Ibiza. A lot of people wanted to get in just for that, later i realized it was a place just more than the vivacious social life that happened there. I arrive in a Goan port city along with my parents-it's first time in my life a train journey stretching more than 1000 kms for the . They put me up in a resort by the beach and beleive me it was a paradise. I enjoyed the orientation just for the stay there.

Fast forward, I am standing in front of this huge rocket lauucher looking vessel that is like 150 feet tall. Nobody would speak when you are around that thing because there was such sharp noise of machines you would not hear any thing that is capable from a human vocal cords. Let me bring out my text book and decipher what's happening here. "Nah, farm boy! throw it away and be a true factory warrior" came a calloused voice from behind. I said: Hey What's up?"
